      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>Since we don't have a situation for if the wake up time is not 7 nothing will be printed. But if wakeuptime satisfies the comparison we print out I can catch the bus to school. </p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>If the wakeuptime matches the if expression the loop will finish there and print that we can take the bus. If not it
        will continue to the else statemenet and print that we have to drive to school
      </p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>In both situations since wakeuptime is none of our conditions in either the if or else if statements it will default to the else statement which is that we have to drive to school</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>This depends on what comparison is being made. The if else loop will check default to whichever one is accurate </p>
      <p>If we write our comparison so that our number should be greater than zero, then zero will result in negative.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the basic if else loop in part 4 doesn't have the ability to handle zero.</p>
