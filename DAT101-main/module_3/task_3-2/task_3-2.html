      <li>[Question 1]</li>
      <p>[Well I assume so. I used two seperate loops but both go from 1 to 10]</p>
      <p>I suppose I could've added something like 11-i to the first loop to accomplish the same thing as the second loop </p>
      <p> then it would just be something like 11-1, 11-2, 11-3...</p>
      <li>[Question 2]</li>
      <p>[As is the loop runs until the guees equals the correctguess]</p>
      <p> If i removed guess !== correctguess from the while, then it would never exit as it wouldn't have any reason to close the loop</p>
      <li>Question 3]</li>
      <p>[It would take billions of guesses before we would even register it as taking any time at all]</p>
      <p> the part 3 guess which is between 1 and 1 million takes on average a single millisecond</p>
      <p> javascript is a single threaded language so it won't be able to do anything while the guessing loop runs</p>
      <p>I suppose if the guessing loop was truly complicated and extensive then it would hamper the performance of the rest of the program</p>
      <p> but it would take some effort to create a simple loop like this that would take that kind of effort</p>
      <li>[Question 4]</li>
      <p>[This depends on which loop is the row and coloumn. We can change the order by swapping which one is the inner and outer loop]</p>
