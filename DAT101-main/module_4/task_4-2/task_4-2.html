      <li>What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!</li>
      <p>a "linear data structure where all elements are arranged sequentially"</p>

      <li>What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hard
        coding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding").</li>
      <p>hard wiring values directly into our source code, like in task 1 when i made an array with numbers 1-20.
        thats just a part of the code now, it is "hard coded in" and cannot be altered except by changing the source code
      </p>

      <li>Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we
        (humans) don't "know" how long the array is.</li>
      <p>Doesn't really matter. We use a for loop that starts at 0 and goes for as long as the array is by using .length</p>

      <li>Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?</li>
      <p>Well we dont but is beneficial because if we had a very large array we could easily group similar objects</p>

      <li>n/a</li>
      <p>n/a</p>

      <li>In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.</li>
      <p>the callback routine continues comparing pairs until all elements are arranged in the correct order</p>

      <li>n/a</li>
      <p>n/a</p>

      <li>n/a</li>
      <p>n/a</p>
