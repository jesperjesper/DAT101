      <li>Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</li>
      <p>It software development more modular, reusable, and maintainable</p>
      <li>In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
        how this type of object can help us in software development</li>
      <p>It is used for storing constants. It is useful because if we wanted to add more we have a centralized place for account types. It is also easy to read and use</p>
      <li>Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?
        Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.</li>
      <p>Encapsulating classes reduces complexity in our code. It also allows us to control when and how the code is accessed</p>
      <p>We use the hashtag symbol to create private members</p>
      <li>Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.</li>
      <p> creates a new instance of that function or class. Essentially, it allows us to make blueprints that we can use later </p>
